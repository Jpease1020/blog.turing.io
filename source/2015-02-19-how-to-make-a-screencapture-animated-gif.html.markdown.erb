[Atom](https://atom.io/)'s discuss page uses animated gifs
to illustrate what the user is trying to write in words.
It seems to work well, and I've become a fan. So, how do you,
reader, make your own.

The primary tool you need is called LICEcap, and you can get it at
[http://www.cockos.com/licecap/](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).

Once you have it, to make a recording:

<%= image_tag 'article_images/how-to-screencapture.gif', class: 'wide-screenshot' %>

## Run it

Easy way is to do `open /Applications/LICEcap.app` from the terminal,
but you can also use an application launcher like spotlight or Alfred.

## Start it

* Position it over the thing you want to show.
* Click "record".
* Choose a filename and location.
* Click "save"

## Note the delay

In the lower left, you'll see a 3 second countdown.
Use this time to select your window.

## Record it

Perform the thing you want to show. Click stop when finished.

## Open it

There's a few ways to do this. I usually open it with my browser.
If you're not using Opera, just switch `Opera.app` with `Firefox.app`
or whichever you use (props if you get Lynx to display them).

```sh
# I think `open` is a mac command, so your computer might work differently
$ open -a Opera.app ~/Desktop/example-screencapture.gif
```

You can also open it in Finder (also a Mac only thing),
and then press the spacebar.

```sh
$ open -R ~/Desktop/how-to-screencapture.gif
```

## Going further!

So, Mac's Preview.app is pretty epic,
you can actually edit individual frames with it,
look in the upper right for an edit button (pencil in a square).

<%= image_tag 'article_images/edit-screencapture.png', class: 'wide-screenshot' %>

The downside is that it will save with a much larger filesize.
But, you can use [Gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) to fix that.
Upside of gifsicle is it's kinda amazing for things like compression and extracting images.
Downside is it hates local colour tables, and I legit spent hours failing to get
it to change the duration of a frame I'd edited.

This is the command I ran to get it to remove local colour tables in the above screencapture,
and reduce the filesize by 57% using.

```sh
$ gifsicle --batch a.gif -O3 --colors 256
```
