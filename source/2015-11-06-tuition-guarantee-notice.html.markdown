[The Colorado Division of Private Occupational Schools (DPOS)]((http://highered.colorado.gov/dpos/)) is the state body that is in charge of regulating all schools that do not fit into the university or general higher education category. It has the authority to establish educational standards, ethical business practices and financial responsibility, and it is in charge of determining whether applicants (prospective schools) are qualified to operate a private occupational school.

When Turing originally applied with DPOS to have the program approved, it was done with the Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee in place. While schools are prohibited from guaranteeing job placement, Turing felt that the Tuition Guarantee was not guaranteeing an outcome but guaranteeing that tuition would be reimbursed if a student graduated the program, diligently participated in a job hunt, and was still unable to gain employment.

At the time of the initial application, DPOS agreed with Turing’s thoughts about the issue, and approved the program with the Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee in place and advertised.

Recently, DPOS informed Turing that it had not interpreted the law correctly and that it had made a mistake when it approved the Turing Program with the Tuition Guarantee in place. DPOS has reevaluated its interpretation of Turing’s Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee, and it has decided that Turing is no longer in compliance with state laws, and that offering the Tuition Reimbursement is now deemed to be in violation of state statute. Turing was informed that it must cease to offer the guarantee immediately if it is to remain in compliance with regulations.

It is due to this decision that Turing has been required to remove the Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee from its program and it is no longer able to offer it to future students.

Any students that are currently enrolled and have started classes as of November 1, 2015, prior to the change in policy mandated by DPOS, will not be affected by the new ruling. Turing will continue to honor its contractual agreements made with each of its current students, and with those who have graduated and are in the three month job search period.

The DPOS' decision won't affect our prospective students' outcome. We are deeply invested in our students' success. We will still maintain our job search assistance program, and we will continue to work with each student to develop a job search plan, get assistance in drafting resumes, prepare for technical interviews and provide professional development tools.

**94 percent of our graduates** find employment as professional software developers within 3 months after graduation.
