## Teaching yourself online vs. actually going to a Coding School

Initially you find yourself wanting to learn how to code. You’re on your way of becoming a code ninja. Your Googlefu is strong and you have a set playlist to jam out to while grinding your way through tutorials.

First off, great job at kickstarting a new chapter. A new hope is building inside of you and you are ready to change your life, or at the very least *change the way you understand how computers actually work*.

Your support group? Your family, your closest friends, and possibly some strangers on the internet. You browse Reddit, Stackoverflow, Quora, and IRC like it’s your job. What you find difficult is getting direct answers, or even non-answers.

If you don’t understand the material you are reading, or possibly copy pasting, you have no direct avenue to ask questions and understand the authors context.

After about 5 months of self teaching I decided to apply to [Turing](http://turing.io). I got in, and now I am dumbfounded by how much I don’t actually know. Retrospect after 3 weeks: I am glad I dove in the deep end.

The community is fantastic. People come from all walks of life, have different ideas on how to tackle a problem, and the instructors have this great sense of making you comfortable with the uncomfortable. Learning to find your way is an important skill and so far, I have learned so much in just 3 weeks.

Just like your brain, you build new patterns. You wake up earlier, you go to sleep a little later, you ask more questions than you ever though you would, and you tackle little problems at a time.

The toughest part of learning by yourself online is that you have no direction. Cool, you learned basic syntax, but do you know the Object Model? Have you been forced to build a class containing multiple methods that talk to each other? From my experience, your answer is unfortunately a no and that is the *dark side* of free stuff.

When you are alone at home, you feel like you can tackle the world. The one thing that is very hard to do, is to take what you *learned* and *build* a project.

Four days ago I *built* a Markdown to HTML converter [(my git repo)](https://github.com/selfup/chisel). Yesterday I finished a project that involved *building* a linked list [(my git repo)](https://github.com/selfup/linked_list) from scratch and only “running” it using tests. Yesterday we began enigma, which is pretty much a Turing Machine. Welcome to Turing right?

The difference at [Turing](http://turing.io) is that they *challenge you*, they force you to branch out, and most of all they *accelerate* your learning. When learning on your own you can always be like “eh, I will learn more about this later”. When learning at a code school, **later is now**.

While traversing the minefield that is free online tutorials, I never learned about TDD (Test Driven Development). I had to unlearn tackling a problem via coding a solution first. Now I test first, write code second, add edge cases, watch my code break, and build it stronger. This method really *solidifies* what you are doing, and you will never forget how you got there.

So far the first module alone has made me realize that this is how you learn to code the right way.

*The contrast between online self learning and Turing is quite alarming.*

Humility is something that everyone has here now. Whether they had it before or not, it’s being learned. The social aspect changes all of the things. It builds humility and makes a big difference.
