NESTA Launches in Partnership with the White House

Today, in partnership with the White House and President Obama's TechHire initiative, top coding bootcamps AppAcademy, DevBootcamp, Flatiron School, General Assembly, Galvanize, Hackbright Academy, Hack Reactor, MakerSquare, Turing School, and Wyncode are announcing the formation of a trade organization, the New Economy Skills Training Association (NESTA). NESTA's mission is to establish best practices, standards, and increase accountability for outcome-based NEST organizations.  Their first initiative is a standard outcome reporting methodology.

As part of their commitment, NESTA wrote a letter to President Obama outlining their commitment to publish outcomes on an annual basis and have them verified by third-party CPA's, based on the following agreed upon criteria: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/76zqbjy4ky8z29f/NESTA%20Letter%20to%20the%20POTUS.pdf?dl=0).
