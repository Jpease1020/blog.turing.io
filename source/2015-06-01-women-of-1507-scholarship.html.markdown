## Why Women and Why July?

Turing School of Software & Design is on a mission to open the world of programming to more great people. We do this by intentionally welcoming people from all backgrounds into the Turing program for an unsurpassed education in software development. We then focus 100% on student success and prepare all of our graduates to launch remarkable careers as software developers. We believe our differences matter and that building diverse teams who can work well together creates better technology for all.

The Women of 1507 Scholarship is launching now because we want to see more women in technology and we recognize that starts within our own walls. Current enrollment in July’s 1507 cohort is at 28% women, and we want to move closer to 50%. The 1507 Scholarship program is a small and immediate step to make our program more accessible and affordable for all. We look forward to expanding and developing scholarships in the future to include more underrepresented groups and those with various levels of financial need.
