Allie was not supposed to be good at programming.

Her parents didn't go to college, so she never did. She worked at restaurants to pay the bills.

"I was never attached to the idea of college", she says now.

She found computers interesting, but never gave them a try. For her, those were things that her brother used for playing games.

She was a good student. Still, she found school boring and full of busy work. After graduating from high school, she moved out of Rockford, Illinois. Rockford —she knew— was not a great place to live.

She arrived to Colorado a couple of years ago, became a pastry chef and worked at Whole Foods. Her boyfriend at the time convinced her to apply to Turing.

Allie is one of our best students.

Every time that people ask us what are we looking for, I always think of Allie: someone driven, smart, and hardworking. Someone looking for collaboration opportunities. Someone willing to devote herself to 7 months of intense learning.

Our students come from various backgrounds. They are school teachers, biologists, recent high-school graduates, MBAs, writers and veterans. But as diverse as they may be, they all share the same indescribable passion that makes us proud.

And it is in this diversity and passion that we thrive.
