Check out a sampling of lightning talks from the last week:

### Exploring the MEAN Stack by Tom Leskin (1502 cohort)

At Turing, students are taught to become diverse developers that are able to think logically and can use any programming language as a tool to solve a problem. In my Lightning Talk while in Module 3, I chose to explore the MEAN Stack. The MEAN Stack is made up of four frameworks: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js. It uses a singe language language across the entire stack and has been said to increase productivity. I realize that I may not be programming in Ruby and Rails after Turing, so I wanted to explore other frameworks and drive deeper into JavaScript.

### Start Thinking Like a Programmer by Chelsea Worrel (1503 cohort)

Day 1 of programming I knew nothing - absolutely nothing, I didn’t even have a computer until the end of the day.  Everything was foreign to me and to say that I had zero experience before I began is completely accurate.  Here we are at approximately day 123 do I know everything? Hardly! Have I seen progress? Heck yeah - that’s the thing, especially when it comes to programming - it’s hard, but if you can find ways to improve and get better then eventually one day you’ll be able to say: ‘I've got this.'  The best part about programming, in my opinion, is that I’ll never be an expert, but you probably won’t be either - because it’s about always learning, growing and continuing to have problems and find ways to solve them.  Some tips to help get you into the developer mindset can help - never giving up - can help, accepting that you will always need help - helps! Here is to continuing on day by day -line by line of code in the world of being a developer.

### The Agricultural, Industrial, Digital Revolutions, and The Information Age by Dustin Gault (1412 cohort)

This talk is a brief summary of a massive topic: the history of technology. First, let's take a walk down memory lane with the Agricultural Revolution of 10,000 BCE, which drastically changed societies forever. Then, let's skip ahead to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, which increased production, wealth, and solidified economic class differences - creating the words 'proletariat' and 'bourgeois'. Finally, let's discuss to the Digital Revolution and the Information Age we are currently living in, which includes the 1%, as well as exciting new technologies and possibilities for the future tech revolution on the horizon.
