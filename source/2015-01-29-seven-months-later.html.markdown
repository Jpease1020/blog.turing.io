It’s been a wild seven months here at Turing. Today’s my last day of my final module, and so I’m here to share seven of the most important lessons I’ve learned:

1. Software development is hard. There is nothing easy about it, regardless of how easy others might make it look. Programming is a challenge of logic, creativity, discipline, and communication. There will always be more to learn. There will never be finished code. It’s okay to be uncomfortable with this; it’s better to embrace it.
2. Put in the hard work first, then get creative. One of the most frustrating parts of learning any new language is struggling with the desire to speak it fluently on day one. Trying to understand something, though, without having the vocabulary to speak coherently about it is a lost cause. Pay your dues and learn the system before anything else. By building fluency, you allow connections to fall naturally into place. Then, with fluency, you’ll be able to do incredible things.
3. Reach out to people. Seriously. Just like, send them emails. My favorite template is something like, “Hey! My name is Sara. I think the work that you’re doing is super cool, and I want to know more about it. Here’s a (very little) bit about my background and why I’m interested. Let’s chat?” The worst they could do is not respond.
4. Especially for the women and people of color in the crowd: People will not be shy about their doubts. I’ve learned that I have a very least favorite question: “You’re a software developer? You can’t be a software developer. You don’t look like one.” I’ve had a lot of opportunities to test out my responses over these past seven months. The best I’ve found: “Don’t you think there should be more software developers who look like me?” Shuts them up every time.
5. Read. Read everything. Read the best examples of code you can find, and think critically about the choices made. Read technical blogs. Read Twitter conversations. Stay on top of what’s going on in the industry. Read other things, too. Poetry will make you think about syntax in entirely new ways. Novels will make you more empathetic.
6. Own your strengths, but be aware of your weak spots and seek out ways to improve. Don’t laugh about the fact that you’re horrible with design. Don’t complain about the fact that DevOps is terrifying. Any even innocuous comment about weakness in a given area is bound to make you look absurd. If you can’t make these connections and recognize how knowledge in one discipline might strengthen another, you’re not thinking very hard.
7. Find another passion, too. I’ve long believed that the most interesting people around have two vastly diverse and well-trained tricks up their sleeves. One of my biggest role models is a woman who left her job at the State Department to open her own tea company. Angus Croll's [If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript](http://anguscroll.com/hemingway/) is my favorite book of the year. During the day, Ari Shapiro reports for NPR, and at night, he sings with Pink Martini. Being able to bounce back and forth between two worlds alleviates fatigue in either one. More importantly, it opens up ridiculous doors, sparks fascinating conversations, and makes every ounce of what you do all the more worthwhile and creative.
