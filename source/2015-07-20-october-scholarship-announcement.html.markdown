![Diversity Scholarship](article_images/diversity-scholarship.jpg)

Turing stands for the inclusion and equality of all people, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, zip code, background, or life experience. When we look at the tech industry overall, though, we see significant biases and a lot of missing faces. So many amazing people who could make monumental contributions to software development have not yet entered the field. This needs to change.

People build software to solve problems, but we tend to only solve problems when we know they exist. Until the experiences of all software developers begin to mirror the experiences of all software users, real problems will remain unsolved and real needs will remain unmet. If you don’t see yourself as fitting some “typical software developer mold”, then you are exactly who we need. We want you to study at Turing precisely because you break the mold. Your differences are valuable.

At Turing School, we want to do what we can to address whatever is holding you back; whether it’s a lack of role models, an unwelcoming and exclusive culture in the industry, unhelpful policies, limited exposure to technology, or simply not realizing what a great fit you might be. We know there are some things we can’t change, but we are committed to accomplishing what we can. Let’s start with access to an unsurpassed education and build a community together. We’ll help you form a support network, connect you with mentors, and stand with you as you launch and grow your career.

One thing we can do right now is help with the cost. In July, we launched our first ever scholarship program for women. Today, we’re expanding the scholarship program to include all underrepresented groups from now on. We have several scholarships available at $4,000/each, starting in October. If you belong to any group that is underrepresented in technology and you are interested in studying at Turing, we invite you to apply.


### Eligibility and Deadlines for October Scholarships:

Scholarship applicants must be accepted into the Turing School of Software & Design for the 1510 cohort, which begins October 12, 2015 and meet the following qualifications:

1. Identify as a member of at least one group that is underrepresented in technology (e.g. Black, Latino/a, Native American, Pacific Islander, Woman, LGBTQ, or veteran)
2. Apply to Turing by completing the admissions application at: http://apply.turing.io no later than September 1, 2015.
3. Be accepted into the school and commit to the October cohort, which starts on October 12, 2015.
4. Upon acceptance, we will ask you to complete a brief (approximately 600-900 word) scholarship essay, the topic of which will be emailed to you upon acceptance. Our scholarship panel will award scholarships based on a combination of your essay response (passion, determination, and financial need) and your application materials (aptitude). Scholarship essays are due by Monday, September 14, 2015.

### How much are the Scholarships Worth?

Scholarships will be awarded in the form of tuition waivers of $4,000 to be applied to your first day payment. Combined with Turing’s deferment options, scholarships will allow recipients to start at Turing for as little as $1,000.

### Scholarship Program Essay (due September 14, 2015):

The purpose of this essay is to allow the scholarship panel to learn more about you, to better understand your passion and determination to become a programmer, and to understand your relative financial need.

1. In 200-300 words, please tell us the story of how you became interested in a career in software development.
2. In 200-300 words, please share something you would be passionate about contributing to the world in the next five years.
3. In 200-300 words, please describe your financial barriers and how participation in this scholarship program could impact your ability to pursue education at Turing and a career in software development.

### How will scholarship recipients be selected?

Turing scholarships will be awarded by a diverse panel drawn from: Turing staff and Board members, Turing alumni, and/or other community leaders. Scholarship levels will be based on demonstration of passion, dedication, aptitude, and relative financial need as demonstrated in the application process and essay responses.

### When will finalists be notified?

Scholarship finalists will be notified by Friday, September 18, 2015.

### What if I belong to a group that’s underrepresented in tech, I want to study at Turing, but money is not my barrier?

Please apply to Turing anyway. While you’re at it, let us know what else we can do to support your education and career. Participation in the scholarship program is entirely up to you, but you are welcome here.

### What if I’m not ready to start in October?

Go ahead and apply for the cohort that works for you and let us know you’re interested in a scholarship. We’ll follow up with the due dates and application deadlines once you’re accepted into the program.
