[The Colorado Division of Private Occupational Schools (DPOS)]((http://highered.colorado.gov/dpos/)) is the state body that is in charge of regulating all schools that do not fit into the university or general higher education category. It has the authority to establish educational standards, ethical business practices and financial responsibility, and it is in charge of determining whether applicants (prospective schools) are qualified to operate a private occupational school.

When Turing originally applied with DPOS to have the program approved, it was done with the Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee in place. While schools are prohibited from guaranteeing job placement, Turing felt that the Tuition Guarantee was not guaranteeing an outcome but guaranteeing that tuition would be reimbursed if a student graduated the program, diligently participated in a job hunt, and was still unable to gain employment.

Since then, DPOS has informed us that we are not permitted to guarantee a refund of tuition based on job placement status upon completion of the program. Any reference to a tuition guarantee found previously on our site or other advertisements is no longer valid

Any students that are currently enrolled and have started classes as of November 1, 2015 will not be affected by the new ruling. Turing will continue to honor its contractual agreements made with each of its current students, and with those who have graduated and are in the three month job search period.

We are deeply invested in our students' success. We will still maintain our job search assistance program, and we will continue to work with each student to develop a job search plan, get assistance in drafting resumes, prepare for technical interviews and provide professional development tools.

**95 percent of our graduates** find employment as professional software developers within three months after graduation. Their average starting salary is $78K.

If you would like more information on this change, please contact DPOS. You can find its contact information [here](http://highered.colorado.gov/DPOS/About/staff.html).
