Whether you are making a big career decision for the first time or in a mid-career pivot, it can be very overwhelming to undergo such a big change.

The technology industry is vast and there are many paths to take.

The first step is to acknowledge your current state and be objective as to how committed you are to making this life-changing decision.

Ask yourself these questions:

* Do I enjoy telling other people about my current work?
* Am I proud of the work I do? Do I feel like I make useful contributions to the world?
* Do I respect my supervisor?
* Am I rewarded and noticed when I work hard?
* Am I compensated adequately?

If you answer no to many of these, it’s time for a career switch.

Now that you know a change needs to take place, it’s time to decide whether you are ready to make a commitment.

Ask yourself the following:

* Will this drastically affect my schedule?
* Am I willing to relocate?
* Will it hinder my relationships with my partner or children?
* What is my current financial situation? Do I have any savings or do I need a loan?

Don’t be discouraged if you decide that it isn’t the exact time to make a leap. You can always set milestones and hold yourself accountable to a plan. Perhaps you can start by revamping your resume or taking a one week online class to learn more about programming.

Also, find a close friend to be your support system. Sometimes all we need is a good push and encouragement to be productive.

Fear will be a constant voice that creeps in when you don’t have the answers right away. Do not let it intimidate you! For those who are making a mid-career change, do you recall having sluggish mornings where you dread going to work?

Don’t ignore that dissatisfaction, because you owe it to yourself to do something that makes you excited to wake up and challenges you to be at your best.

Only you and your own determination can make this happen.
