Last week one of my closest friends, [Jake Brewer](http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/09/26/mary-katharine-ham-memorializes-her-husband-jake-brewer), died in a cycling accident. I've spent
the last week reflecting with those he left behind.

In a remembrance his friend [Michael Silberman](https://twitter.com/silbatron) said *"there was no idea too optimistic for Jake. Most of us work to fix an issue, Jake worked to fix democracy."* One of Jake's teammates said *"nothing felt as powerful as when he believed in you. Sometimes the hardest part was living up to the **'potential you'** that he saw."* For me, personally, Jake's faith and encouragement propelled me to start Jumpstart Lab, Hungry Academy, gSchool, and Turing.

But there was something you couldn't miss about the week. There weren't just a dozen
people who felt that way. There were hundreds. His funeral at the National
Cathedral had over a thousand attendees. Every one of them could have told you
stories about **their Jake**.

How could one person be so special to so many? Sure, he worked hard. But many people work hard. He was good at things. But many people are good at things. He was kind. But many people are kind. What was the special thing that caused people to build strong connections to Jake so quickly?

Jake was known for singing. He'd sing washing the dishes. He'd sing walking to a
meeting. He'd sing midway up a punishing climb on the bike. You couldn't help but
smile, laugh, and maybe shake your head.

I realize now that was his superpower. He wasn't showing off, he was reminding the rest of us that life is fucking awesome. Most of us are scared to embarrass ourselves. He, instead, embraced and exposed vulnerability. Singing was just one facet. He was an open soul who was always willing to try something. He made it alright for the rest of us to open up, too.

When Jake was around you felt better. His face, his attention, his
questions and his faith filled you with belief in yourself. Jake was a person that
saw potential in every moment. He saw every one of us as agents of change. Even
when he didn't know you. In his life there were no strangers, there were only friends he hadn't met yet. And that spirit came through in every conversation.

In his memory and in his image, let's work on things that matter, believe that
we'll make a difference, and most of all believe that we're at our best when we
work together. We can laugh, we can hurt, we can be vulnerable, and together we'll
finish this climb he started.
