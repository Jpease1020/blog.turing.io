One thing that can come as a shock to our incoming students is the expectation that they’ll work on developing their public speaking and presentation skills while they’re here. We want people to graduate from Turing with a level of comfort pitching and presenting ideas - whether it’s at a conference, with a client, or in a staff meeting.

To practice this, students prepare and present five-minute lightning talks on Fridays, and sometimes to a larger audience on Community Nights. The topics students choose range from DDoS to Computer-Aided Dispatch Systems to Strategies for Pairing.

In this lightning talk, Lori Culberson, a student from the 1502 cohort, shares how her time at Turing made her redefine what it means to win. If you’re learning how to code or thinking of tackling anything new, check out Lori’s valuable insights.
