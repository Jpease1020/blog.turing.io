Last month, Turing School hosted a “speed dating” style community hiring event to connect our students with executives, developers, and hiring managers representing a bunch of great companies from Denver and beyond. Two of them even sent Turing alumni to recruit on their behalf, and it was the best feeling in the world to see those familiar faces sitting on the other side of the table. It’s incredible to realize we’ve reached a stage in our journey where Turing alumni are established enough to help bring on new developers for the companies where they work!

The day of our big event, Turing was a hive of activity as we transformed our classrooms into interview spaces, calmed nerves, wondered what to wear, and hoped that no one would cancel. It was very much like getting ready for a blind date - except that we also had to print 400 copies of résumés and order a nacho bar. Once everyone had filled their plates and settled into the rapid interview format, nervousness was replaced by the buzz of people connecting. The whole thing was fun for us and fun for our guests. It was also incredibly valuable for our job seekers who gained practice interviewing, arranged follow-up interviews, and received great job offers!

As things wound down, however, the evening - kind of like this post - took an unexpected turn.

While everyone was packing up to go home, one of our guest interviewers asked to share some feedback. He commented on the event format and the quality of our students; then, he started sharing the advice he’d been giving our students and grads all evening - really good advice about jobs and life. He reflected on stress, burnout, and imposter syndrome. He talked about how hard the job can be and how important it is for people who want to become programmers to know what they’re getting into and to prepare for the stressful workloads, tight timelines, and high expectations. He talked about how important it is for us as a community to encourage each other to have interests outside of programming and to try coming up for air regularly.  

It was a short conversation, but moving because here was this person who had clearly achieved a lot and been successful; but, when he talked about imposter syndrome, stress, and burnout, there was no disguising that he’d been impacted by these things on a deeply personal level. He’d come to our event in support of our emerging developers and it was clear that he felt like addressing these issues was a big part of that support.

Our chat was also moving because it was timely for us at Turing. We had just come through a stressful assessment week and the questions circulating around the Turing staff table and keeping us up at night were all related to this. How do we help people manage the stress of this program? How do we help them emerge with the level of confidence we know they should have and need going into the interview process? How do we help people remember to breathe? How do we support each and care for everyone involved in this crazy, intense community where we all have high expectations for ourselves and others. How do we serve as an adequate support system for the many students who have left their families and friends behind to join us here? These questions are big questions and we don’t have the answers yet, but we can share what we’re learning so far.

The most tangible way we’ve found to support our students’ mental health as they grapple with the emotional strain of going through our intense program is actual therapy. We’ve been lucky to be able to work with a therapist who is also a Turing graduate and software developer to provide counseling sessions for our students. Students work directly and confidentially with the therapist and Turing picks up the tab.

Less tangibly but more broadly, we’ve also found the following to be helpful:

* **Laughter**: We are serious about learning, but we know that making space to laugh every day makes learning and life better. The fact that we enjoy being together at Turing keeps us motivated and inspired to show up and work hard even on the bad days.

* **Culture and Community**: We spend a lot of time noticing the people who make up our community and improving the ways we connect with each other. Starting with admissions and reaching into our ever-expanding network of alumni and mentors, our environment is set up to attract those who are mindful of building each other up and supporting a positive, healthy, and inclusive culture for all. Everyone here shares responsibility for building community with each other and those around us.

* **Vulnerability**: Maintaining a safe community makes room for people to be vulnerable. Being able to admit our shortcomings and failures with people who accept us and want us to succeed creates fertile ground for risk, creativity, innovation, and growth. We believe that cultivating these traits will ultimately choke out the stress of shame-related, creativity killing issues like imposter syndrome and perfectionism.

We’re aware that we fall short in these things, but we prioritize them and pursue them because we know that moving toward them makes us a better school that turns out better developers who are also better people who work harder to build a better community - and all of that really does have the potential to impact the world. It’s also kind of woven into our DNA and a lot more fun than the alternative.

See anything we’ve missed? Agree? Disagree? Want to share what you’re learning with us? We’d love to hear what you have to say.
