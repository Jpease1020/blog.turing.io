Why is programming greatness important?

In a previously lost interview from 1995, Steve Jobs explained the difference between the best software developers and average ones:
> In most businesses, the difference between average and good is at best 2 to 1, right? Like, if you go to New York and you get the best cab driver in the city, you might get there 30% faster than with an average taxicab driver. A 2 to 1 gain would be pretty big.

> The difference between the best worker on computer hard-ware and the average may be 2 to 1, if you're lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software, it's at least 25 to 1. The difference between the average programmer and a great one is at least that.

> The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world. And when you're in a field where the dynamic range is 25 to 1, boy, does it pay off.

## Developing Programming Talent

In the *The Talent Code* , New York Times best selling author Daniel Coyle breaks down talent into the following three components:

__Deep Practice__

Not all types of practice are equal. Deep practice will allow you to develop your skills about ten times faster than conventional practice.

__Ignition__

One of the biggest differences between high achievers and everyone else is a higher level of commitment which a lot of us call passion. Passion is born out of our deep unconscious and triggered by primal cues. Learning how to ignite passion to catalyze skill development is a must when developing talent.

__Master Coaching__

Coyle identifies four virtues that can be found in the best coaches around the world. I encourage coaches to look into these four virtues but what students need to know is that a master coach is pivotal to their development and a master coach will inspire deep practice, the first element of Coyle's Talent Code, and fuel their students with passion, the second element of the talent code.

The three elements of *The Talent Code* work together within your brain to form a microscopic neural substance called myelin. Myelin adds immense amounts of accuracy and speed to your movements and thoughts. The most recent discoveries regarding myelin and it's connection to skill development makes scientists consider it as the foundation of all forms of excellence, from Mozart's to Michelangelo's. The great news that come along with these discoveries is that myelin isn't fixed at birth, it grows, and like anything that grows it can be cultivated and nourished.

## How To Know You're On The Right Track

Learning how to program is a long and treacherous road so for all of you starting on the journey I encourage you to consider these three questions:

__1. When programming (or reading about programming) always ask yourself, am I in deep practice?__

If you don't know the answer to that question pickup a copy of *The Little Book of Talent* by Daniel Coyle, where you'll find a lot of examples of what deep practice looks like. If you want to dig deeper get the extended version, *The Talent Code*.

__2. Do you know how to ignite passion?__

Deep practice will take a lot of energy and discipline. You will need passion to fuel you. If you're not one of the few people for which passion has been naturally ignited by the environment around you, make it a point to learn how these signals (passion) work so you can reverse engineer it. Do you know how these signals work?

__3. Do you have a master coach (trainer/teacher)? Do they inspire deep practice and fuel you with passion?__

If not, it's time to make a change.
