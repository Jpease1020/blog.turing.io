We practice a lot of pair programming here are Turing, both in big projects and also small exercises. To be honest, I'm not always super excited about it. I find working with humans to be challenging. We all think and approach problems differently, we have different questions and come up with different answers, we deal with stress in different ways,we have different lives and schedules, etc. All of these factors can make pair programming exhausting and frustrating and awkward, and group projects are no different. Which is why I was really looking forward to "the personal project". 

In the third module at Turing we have an entire project to plan and execute entirely by ourselves. About three days into my personal project, I actually came to believe what they have been telling us all along: those exhausting, frustrating, and awkward moments with other people actually improve whatever it is we're working on.

Coding a web application completely by yourself is not that hard. With a little help from Michael Hartl anyone can create a twitter-like application within a couple days (give or take). But I am going to go ahead and make the strong statement that it is impossible to code something great or create a great product totally by yourself. A rubber duck can't completely replace the value we humans get from bouncing ideas back and forth, talking through database schemas, or just venting about an issue. These interactions with others are invaluable to our thought process; we all do approach things differently and that is why we can create something greater together. 

My personal project turned out just fine, but I know that the watercooler-type conversations I had with my fellow cohort members made it invariably better (and also a little less buggy). I still find pair programming to be exhausting and slow, and the stress dreams come back for every group project. But without a doubt the end product with any group project is better than if I were coding in a room by myself.
